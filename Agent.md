# ProcureIQ Agent Rules & Policies Reference

This document compiles and references all critical guidelines, folder structures, and coding standards defined across the `ProcureIQ` project. Every agent must read and adhere to these policies before planning, generating, or reviewing code.

## 🛑 Critical & Non-Negotiable Rules
- never delete anything insted fix existing code first actually and new changes should not break existing changes new changes must be conditional and addictive and try to use declarative approch please 
- never write logic in frontend
- use statemenagemet in frontend and maintain saga pattern please 
The absolute non-negotiable rules for the project are defined in the [Critical Rules](file:///home/btpl-lap-22/live/ProcureIQ/policies/rules/critical.rule.md) policy. Key mandates include:

1. **No Assumptions**: Never make assumptions. If anything is unclear, ask the user.
2. **Contract-First Approach**: Always update/write contracts first, then database migration files, then the business logic.
3. **No Cross-Package Source Imports**: Sub-packages must be completely isolated.
4. **No Code From Scratch**: Use existing libraries and package methods instead of reinventing code.
5. **Distributed Tracing**: Always use OpenTelemetry for tracing.
6. **Log All Decisions**: Keep [change.log](file:///home/btpl-lap-22/live/ProcureIQ/logs/change.log) updated with an ASCII decision tree for every change.
7. **Write and Run Tests**: Always write test cases and run them after code modifications.

## 📁 Folder & API Structure Rules

All projects must strictly follow the defined directory layout and boundary policies:

* **[API-First Folder Structure](file:///home/btpl-lap-22/live/ProcureIQ/policies/rules/folderStructure/api-structure.md)**:
  * No code is written in `src/` until the API contract (OpenAPI, GraphQL SDL, AsyncAPI, or proto) is written and merged.
  * Structure defines `src/api/` for entrypoints, `src/features/` for pure business logic, and `src/infra/` for adapters and clients.
* **[Multiple Package Structure](file:///home/btpl-lap-22/live/ProcureIQ/policies/rules/folderStructure/package-structure.md)**:
  * Outlines language workspace layouts (Java, Python, Node, Go, Rust) and cross sub-package communication boundaries.
  * Sub-packages must be fully isolated; runtime calls go through versioned contracts and generated clients.
* **[Models Structure Rules](file:///home/btpl-lap-22/live/ProcureIQ/policies/rules/folderStructure/models-structure.md)**: Establishes separation between database entities, internal domain models, and API exchange DTOs.
* **[Feature Registry](file:///home/btpl-lap-22/live/ProcureIQ/policies/rules/folderStructure/feature-registry.md)**: Central directory mapping of all application features.

## 🛠️ Code Quality Policies

Every sub-package must satisfy strict code quality metrics:

* **[Coupling Strength Spectrum](file:///home/btpl-lap-22/live/ProcureIQ/policies/rules/codeQuality/coupling-strength-spectrum.md)** & **[Coupling Taxonomy](file:///home/btpl-lap-22/live/ProcureIQ/policies/rules/coupling-taxonomy.md)**: Guidelines on managing dependencies and avoiding high coupling.
* **[DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)](file:///home/btpl-lap-22/live/ProcureIQ/policies/rules/codeQuality/dry.md)**: Standard duplication checks.
* **[Function Parameter Limit](file:///home/btpl-lap-22/live/ProcureIQ/policies/rules/codeQuality/function-parameter-limit-rule.md)**: Restricts function arguments to prevent signature pollution.
* **[Package Naming Rules](file:///home/btpl-lap-22/live/ProcureIQ/policies/rules/codeQuality/package-namming-rules.md)**: Standard capitalization and separator guidelines.
* **[Prototype Rules](file:///home/btpl-lap-22/live/ProcureIQ/policies/rules/codeQuality/prototype.md)**: Scoping policies for temporary or prototype modules.
* **[SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)](file:///home/btpl-lap-22/live/ProcureIQ/policies/rules/codeQuality/srp.md)**: Design policies ensuring single-purpose classes and modules.
* **[Typecasting Rules](file:///home/btpl-lap-22/live/ProcureIQ/policies/rules/codeQuality/typecasting-rules.md)**: Policies around type casting safety.

## 🤖 Agent Roles & Workflows

AI agents in this workspace follow a designated pipeline to plan, execute, and verify changes:

* **[Agent Policies Readme](file:///home/btpl-lap-22/live/ProcureIQ/policies/rules/agents/README.md)**:
  * Defines the three roles: **Policy Guardian**, **Code Generator**, and **Code Reviewer**.
  * Outlines the step-by-step workflow: *User Request -> Policy Guardian (Validate Plan) -> Code Generator (Implement) -> Code Reviewer (Audit) -> Commit*.
* **[Policy Guardian](file:///home/btpl-lap-22/live/ProcureIQ/policies/rules/agents/policy-guardian.md)**: Compliance validator. Performs pre-implementation and post-implementation validation.
* **[Code Generator](file:///home/btpl-lap-22/live/ProcureIQ/policies/rules/agents/code-generator.md)**: Implementation agent focused on writing compliant components.
* **[Code Reviewer](file:///home/btpl-lap-22/live/ProcureIQ/policies/rules/agents/code-reviewer.md)**: Review agent verifying generated code.

---

## 🔌 Networks & Migration

* **[mTLS Migration Strategy](file:///home/btpl-lap-22/live/ProcureIQ/policies/rules/networks/migration/mTLS_migration.md)**: Step-by-step migration procedures for network security.
* **[Decentralized Network Rules](file:///home/btpl-lap-22/live/ProcureIQ/policies/rules/networks/decentralized-network/critical.rule.md)**: Communication protocols for zero-trust architectures.

## 📝 Git & Runbook Rules

* **[Git Branch Naming Rules](file:///home/btpl-lap-22/live/ProcureIQ/policies/rules/git/git-branch-naming-rules.md)**: Strict naming formatting for git branches.
* **[ADR (Architectural Decision Records)](file:///home/btpl-lap-22/live/ProcureIQ/policies/rules/runbook/adr.md)**: How to document long-term design decisions.
* **[Feature Flag / Circuit Breaker](file:///home/btpl-lap-22/live/ProcureIQ/policies/rules/runbook/ffsb.md)**: Rules on feature flag controls and decoupling logic.
* **[Runtime Adaptor Pattern](file:///home/btpl-lap-22/live/ProcureIQ/policies/runtime-adaptor-pattern.md)**: Integration patterns.
